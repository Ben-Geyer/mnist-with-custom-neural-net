A small project from the summer of 2018 that I used to learn about training neural networks. I used the custom implemented neural network class from my project at https://github.com/Ben-Geyer/generalized-neural-net-class. I tried training with each different activation function and optimization method, learning about the strengths and weaknesses of each. 

Please note that, as this project's sole purpose was my own learning, I did not spend time adding comments or refactoring code.
